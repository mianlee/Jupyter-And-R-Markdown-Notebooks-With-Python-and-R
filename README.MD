## Jupyter And R Markdown: Notebooks With Python and R

Here, I am trying to learn how to use Jupyter Notebook for both Python and R. I used Jupyter Notebook before, but I haven't use it for a while. SO, I decided to pick it up.


When working on data science problems, you might want to set up an interactive environment to work and share your code for a project with others. You can easily set this up with a notebook. 

In other cases, youâ€™ll just want to communicate about the workflow and the results that you have gathered for the analysis of your data science problem. For a transparent and reproducible report, a notebook can also come in handy.

### Installing the Jupyter Software

Since I have ```Anaconda```, *which already includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science*, installed on my Mac-computer,  I am ready to use the ```Jupyter Notebook```.

Jupyter Notebook strongly recommend installing ```Python``` and ```Jupyter Notebook``` using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/), you can download and instrall it from, [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

If you install the ```Anaconda```, you have installed ```Jupyter Notebook```! To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

```jupyter notebook```
